- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ruineer
- 👀 I’m interested in continuing to build my tech-stack skillset, music, and puppies... who doesn't like puppies?
- 🌱 I’m currently working on proficiency in cloud development, CI/CD, containerization, IaaC, PaaS, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything mutually beneficial in building the above skillsets.
- 📫 You can reach me at joshua@ruineer.com
